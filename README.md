A fork of the Cubical Agda library, including code from our formalisation of [Distributive Laws of Monadic Containers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17191)
----------------------------------------

### Chris Purdy and Stefania Damato
<br>

The formalisation includes:
* monadic and directed container examples, 
* monadic, directed, monadic-directed, and directed-monadic distributive laws,
* distributive law examples, 
* and proofs of uniqueness of certain concrete distributive laws.
