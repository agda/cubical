This module introduces a way to represent elements of free groups as lists of pairs ([𝟚× A]), where A identifies generators and Bool differentiates a generator from its inverse.


The definition of `_⇊1g` encodes the concept of a word being equivalent to the identity element in a free group. It includes three constructors:
 - The trivial case `[]` represents the identity itself.
 - The `cj` constructor signifies conjugation by a generator, indicating that a word extended by a generator and its inverse is still equivalent to the identity.
 - Lastly, the `_·_` constructor asserts that if two words are each equivalent to the identity, their concatenation will also be equivalent to the identity, preserving the identity property under the group operation.

Then, a `_·_⁻¹≡ε relation`, defined as `λ xs ys → (xs ++ invLi ys) ⇊1g`  captures the relationship where the concatenation of a word with the inverse of another equates to the group identity.

By quotienting by _·_⁻¹≡ε, resulting in the List/↘↙group, a group structure on equivalence classes of lists is established. Here, concatenation acts as the group operation, hence forming the foundation for the free group constructed over A.

Given that _·_⁻¹≡ε functions is equivalence relation, it permits the retrieval of this relationship from paths in the quotient. This feature facilitates the proof of the uniqueness of the normal form in `Cubical.HITs.FreeGroup.NormalForm`.

In the Discrete module, the presence of decidable equality on the type of generators (A) enables the definition of groups without requiring truncation. This utility is used in `Cubical.HITs.Bouquet.Discrete` to demonstrate that a bouquet over a discrete type is an hGroupoid without truncation.
