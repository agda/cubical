 Putting everything together we get:

               ≃
 List/Rᴸ ------------> AList/Rᴬᴸ

   |
   |≃
   |
   ∨
               ≃
 FMSet A ------------> AssocList A


 We thus get that AList/Rᴬᴸ≃AssocList.
 Constructing such an equivalence directly requires count extensionality for association lists,
 which should be even harder to prove than for finite multisets.

 This strategy should work for all implementations of multisets with HITs.
 We just have to show that:

  ∙ The HIT is equivalent to FMSet (like AssocList)
  ∙ There is a bisimulation between lists and the basic data type of the HIT
    with the higher constructors removed (like AList)

 Then we get that this HIT is equivalent to the corresponding set quotient that identifies elements
 that give the same count on each a : A.

 TODO: Show that all the equivalences are indeed isomorphisms of multisets not only of count-structures!
